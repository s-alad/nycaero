                            Initially starting off as the Stuyvesant Rocketry Team,
                            our TARC initiative was the very first mission which 
                            brought our leadership team together. Our goal is to 
                            win the American Rocketry Challenge and claim glory 
                            for New York City.

                            of New York City to win the American Rocketry Challenge 
                            and bring New York City the glory it deserves. Doing this,
                            we hope to inspire a new generation of aerospace engineers 
                            right out of New York City.

They got to see dozens of rockets, and fly their own hand-built rockets!

                            Students joining the TARC section of NYC Aerospace will be assigned to a specific TARC team, dependant on location. Once members are assigned a certain team their team leader will organize meetings, assignments, team events, and launches. Members can also attend our larger events, which will be posted on the site when scheduled. Members will be notified of future steps once they fill out the Join Form.

                            The most important thing our TARC team is looking for students
                            with a passion to learn and succeed. Everything else comes 
                            second hand and can be taught through online resources, 
                            such as our RockED program. Understandings of material physics,
                            projectile physics, computer operations, hardware programming,
                            and craft skills are welcomed and are some of the skills you 
                            expect to learn as part of our team.

                            TARC is broken up into multiple small teams of size 3-10 in
                            order to win the Team America Rocketry Challenge. We focus 
                            on lower to mid power rockets and build custom rockets 
                            carrying 44 grams egg payloads. Between September 1st, 2019,
                            and April 6th, 2020, the rockets will need to be designed, 
                            built and flown to advance to finals. Daily and weekly 
                            assignments will be assigned and coordinated by team managers.
                            As our student-base grows we will be able to organize teams
                            by area, making daily meetings much more accessible. Though
                            commitment will vary day to day or week to week you should expect 
                            to be putting in a solid few hours a week to ensure your team's 
                            success at TARC. In addition, scheduled launches will need to
                            occur outside of New York City, meaning you will occasionally
                            need to commute anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours.
